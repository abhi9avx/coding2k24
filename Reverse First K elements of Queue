Given an integer K and a queue of integers, we need to reverse the order of the first K elements of the queue, leaving the other elements in the same relative order.

Only following standard operations are allowed on queue.

enqueue(x) : Add an item x to rear of queue
dequeue() : Remove an item from front of queue
size() : Returns number of elements in queue.
front() : Finds front item.
Note: The above operations represent the general processings. In-built functions of the respective languages can be used to solve the problem.

Example 1:

Input:
5 3
1 2 3 4 5
Output: 
3 2 1 4 5
Explanation: 
After reversing the given
input from the 3rd position the resultant
output will be 3 2 1 4 5.
Example 2:

Input:
4 4
4 3 2 1
Output: 
1 2 3 4
Explanation: 
After reversing the given
input from the 4th position the resultant
output will be 1 2 3 4.
Your Task:
Complete the provided function modifyQueue() that takes queue and K as parameters and returns a modified queue. The printing is done automatically by the driver code.

Expected Time Complexity : O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space : O(K)

Constraints:
1 <= K <= N <= 105

class GfG {
    // Function to reverse first k elements of a queue.
    public Queue<Integer> modifyQueue(Queue<Integer> q, int k) {
        if (q == null || k <= 0 || k > q.size()) {
            return q;
        }

        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();

        // Push the first K elements into the stack
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            stack.push(q.poll());
        }

        // Pop the elements from the stack and enqueue them back to the queue
        while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
            q.add(stack.pop());
        }

        // Enqueue the remaining elements in the same order
        for (int i = 0; i < q.size() - k; i++) {
            q.add(q.poll());
        }

        return q;
    }
}
